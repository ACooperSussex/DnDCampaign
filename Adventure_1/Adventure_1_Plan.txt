Introduction
---

Player characters meet up to perform the job they were attracted to, meeting at a local traders office to make the arrangements.

Therin, an assistant to a high-profile local trader who owns many of the most lucrative trading ships wants you all to go and check out a disturbance at a warehouse he owns, at the nearby docks. They are to investigate the disturbance, remove it if possible, and return with the shipping documents that are within the warehouse somewhere.

Should the players accept, they will be paid ~200 gp and have proved themselves as useful agents for the trader.
